        <h2>Our Specializations</h2>
        <h4>• Licence (MI)</h4>
        <p>
          This Double Degree offers solid and balanced training in computer
          science and mathematics, to then prepare in excellent conditions for a
          Master's degree in one of the two disciplines or interfaces. It also
          allows you to prepare for entry into major schools. Mathematics and IT
          are at the heart of the digital transition which impacts and
          transforms all activities and professions. Students are trained to
          model problems, seek and find solutions, and code them effectively.
          They acquire the disciplinary foundations and approach the fields of
          machine learning and data science, the foundations of artificial
          intelligence. <br /><br />
          The training places a large emphasis on interdisciplinary projects
          which allow you to develop curiosity and creativity and to learn about
          research and teamwork. <br /><br />
          The emphasis is placed on mastery of written and oral scientific
          communication, in French and English.
          <br />

        <h4>• Licence (ST)</h4>
        <p>
          A License Science et Technologie, also known as a Bachelor of Science
          and Technology, is a three-year undergraduate university program in
          France focused on scientific fields. It can be broadly categorized
          into two types: <br /><br />
          - Multidisciplinary: This type provides a foundation in a wide range
          of scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, biology,
          chemistry, computer science, and engineering. It's suitable for
          students from scientific baccalaureate backgrounds (STi2D, STAV, STL)
          who might need extra support transitioning to university-level
          studies. The aim is to prepare them for further scientific studies in
          a master's program or engineering school. <br />
          - Specialized: This type focuses on a particular scientific
          discipline, such as telecommunications, mechanics, or digital
          technology. The specific area of focus and career paths will vary
          depending on the university offering the program. <br /><br />
          Here are some additional points to consider: <br /><br />
          - The program strengthens the student's scientific approach, including
          how science is learned, managed, and how it interacts with society.<br />
          - Universities have the freedom to design their own course structures
          within the broader License Science and Technology framework. <br />
          - This means the specific curriculum may differ depending on the
          institution. <br />
          - If you're interested in learning more about a specific License
          Science et Technologie program, it's best to consult the website of
          the university you're interested in attending. <br />
        </p>
        <h4>• Licence (SNV)</h4>
        <p>
          Here's what you can expect from a Licence SNV program: <br /><br />
          - Focus: It provides a broad foundation in natural sciences like
          biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, and life sciences like
          biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics. <br />
          - Specializations: Some universities might offer specializations
          within the program, such as Biology, Agronomy, Food Science, or
          Biotechnology. <br />
          - Curriculum: The common core curriculum likely covers general science
          courses, but universities have the flexibility to design specific
          programs with a focus on their strengths and resources. <br />
          - Career Paths: This degree prepares students for further studies in
          Master's programs or specialized schools in various natural and life
          science fields. It can also qualify graduates for entry-level
          positions in laboratories, environmental agencies, or the food
          industry (depending on the specific program). <br /><br />
          For a more detailed understanding of the program content and
          specializations offered, it's advisable to visit the website of the
          particular Algerian university you're interested in.
